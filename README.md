You can use the [Odassey Online](https://odassey.philipgerke.com) deployment. It supports the complete feature set provided by the installable version, with the exception of the option to open EDMX files from the file system.

## Installation ##

You can install Odassey by directly downloading an installer for your platform or by using a package manager. Once installed Odassey automatically informs you about new releases.

### Package Manager ###

At the moment we are only supporting winget, but the target is to support a package manager for all supported operating systems.

#### Windows - Winget ####

```powershell
winget install odassey
```

Soon, you'll also be able to install the drydock version. üëÄ
