## Demo

You can use the [Odassey Online](https://odassey.philipgerke.com) deployment. It supports the complete feature set provided by the installable version, with the exception of the option to open EDMX files from the file system. If you're feeling cocky, you can also use the [Odassey drydock](https://drydock.philipgerke.com) deployment, to try new features ahead of an official release.
